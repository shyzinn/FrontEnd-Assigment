## Intial Idea

The initial idea was create a website clear simple and objective.
I tried to apply everything that was teached in our classes.
We have just .html and CSS and JS being called by a link on the main page.

Also I applied the java  3d library called threejs.org.
this library is very good to work but cause a little problems to applied them.

## Design

Being an emotional person, I love connecting with people emotionally because I believe when you connect with people emotionally you got a lot of their views and questions too.
Thatâ€™s why I choose the design.

## Problems

For me the most difficult was the Library and some addicional scripts added to the project. But I had good assistance from Erika our teacher of the module.
